.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Tenacity
is a graphical audio editor.  This man page does not
describe all of the features of Tenacity or how to use
it; for this, see the html documentation that came with
the program, which should be accessible from the Help
menu.  This man page describes the Unix-specific
features, including special files and environment variables.

Tenacity currently uses
.B libsndfile
to open many uncompressed audio formats such as WAV,
AIFF, and AU, and it can also be linked to
.B libmad,
.B libvorbis,
and
.B libflac,
to provide support for opening MP2/3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC files,
respectively.
.B LAME, libvorbis, libflac
and
.B libtwolame
provide facilities to export files to all these formats as well.

Tenacity is primarily an interactive, graphical editor, not a batch-processing
tool. Whilst there is a basic batch processing tool it is experimental and 
incomplete. If you need to batch-process audio or do simple edits
from the command line, using 
.B sox
or
.B ecasound
driven by a bash script will be much more powerful than Tenacity.

.SH HISTORY

In April of 2021, Muse Group (Muse) had announced that they acquired
Audacity and would further continue development. Later, a new pull
request was then made that would introduce telementry into Audacity.
This caused controversy, but the pull request was ultimately not merged.
The closest to telemetry present in modern versions of Audacity is only
error reporting, where personal information is NOT collected.

In July of 2021, an update to Audacity's privacy policy caused
controversy. It stated that the program was not suitable for
children under 13 years old. This raised a possible GPL violation by.
In addition, a new Contributer License Agreement also provoked
further controversy. All of this sparked the need among Audacity's
community to create forks. As a result, this program, like other
derivatives, came to light in order to solve the wrongdoing that
was committed by Audacity's new owners.

On Noveber 26, 2022, Tenacity development was officially restarted
by Avery King, joining other Tenacity contributors and the lead
Audacium maintainer to continue work on the project towards their
first release: Tenacity 1.3.

.SH FILES
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tenacity/tenacity.cfg
.RS
Per user configuration file.
.RE

.I /var/tmp/tenacity\-<user>/
.RS
Default location of Tenacity's temp directory, where <user> is your
username.  If this location is not suitable (not enough space in
/var/tmp, for example), you should change the temp directory in
the Preferences and restart Tenacity.  Tenacity is a disk-based
editor, so the temp directory is very important: it should always
be on a fast (local) disk with lots of free space.

On many modern Linux systems all files in /tmp/ will be deleted 
each time the system boots up, which makes recovering a recording
that was going on when the system crashed much harder. This is why
the default is to use a directory in /var/tmp/ which will not
normally be deleted by the system. Open the Preferences to check.
.RE
.SH SEARCH PATH
When looking for plug-ins, help files, localization files, or other
configuration files, Tenacity searches the following locations, in
this order:

.I TENACITY_PATH
.RS
Any directories in the 
.I TENACITY_PATH 
environment variable will be searched before anywhere else.
.RE

.I .
.RS
The current working directory when Tenacity is started.
.RE

.* $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tenacity/Plug-Ins

.I <prefix>/share/tenacity
.RS
The system-wide Tenacity directory, where <prefix> is usually
/usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program was installed.
.   RE

.I <prefix>/share/doc/tenacity
.RS
The system-wide Tenacity documentation directory, where <prefix> is usually
/usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program was installed.
.RE

For localization files in particular (i.e. translations of Tenacity
into other languages), Tenacity also searches
.I <prefix>/share/locale

.SH PLUG\-INS

Tenacity supports two types of plug-ins on Unix: LADSPA and Nyquist
plug-ins.  These are generally placed in a directory called 
.I plug\-ins 
somewhere on the search path (see above).

LADSPA plug-ins can either be in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively
in a 
.I ladspa 
directory on the search path if you choose to create one.  Tenacity will
also search the directories in the 
.I LADSPA_PATH 
environment variable for additional LADSPA plug-ins.

Nyquist plug-ins can either be in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively
in a 
.I nyquist
directory on the search path if you choose to create one.

.SH VERSION
This man page documents Tenacity version 1.3

.SH LICENSE

Tenacity is distributed under the GPL, version 2 or later. However,
some of the libraires it links to are distributed under other free
licenses, including the LGPL and BSD licenses.

.SH AUTHORS

.B Audacity Developers

Project leaders include Dominic Mazzoni, Matt Brubeck,
James Crook, Vaughan Johnson, Leland Lucius, and Markus Meyer,
but dozens of others have contributed, and Audacity would not
be possible without wxWidgets, libsndfile, and many of
the other libraries it is built upon.  For the most recent list
of contributors and current email addresses, see our website:
