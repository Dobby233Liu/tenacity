        Hey! We see you're interested in suggesting a feature or other idea for
        Tenacity! Thank you for your interest!

        We please ask that you propose your feature request separately of any
        others. If your request depends on other ideas that are either not
        actively being discussed or worked on, please create a page on the wiki
        instead to detail your feature request. We do not have enough resources
        to address everyone's feature request, let alone implementing them, as
        we have to balance these requests with bug reports.

        Once again, we thank you for your interest and hope to implement your
        feature soon.
